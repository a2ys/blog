        <b>(noun)</b> A person who has an exceptional aptitude in one particular

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Why Savant?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        Savant is a community blog, where everyone has a chance to share their
        knowledge. It was born in early November 2024 as a modern successor to
        my old
        <a href="https://legacy.blog.a2ys.dev" class="text-link">blog</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        Unlike before, Savant focuses on collaboration. Anyone can contribute
        articles, suggest edits, or submit entirely new ideas. Every piece of
        content is hosted publicly on
        <a href="https://github.com/a2ys/blog" class="text-link">GitHub</a> so it's
        transparent, editable, and open-source.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        Whether you're a student, developer, or hobbyist — if you've got
        something worth sharing, Savant gives you a stage.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">The Backstory</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        It all started with <b>Buildspace</b> on July 6th, 2024 — with the 5th season
        of their
        <a
          href="https://x.com/unreal_sapien/status/1809572446896550320"
          class="text-link">Nights & Weekends</a
        > program. That's where the idea for Savant first took shape. The journey
        was genuinely inspiring, and I'm deeply grateful to <b>Farza</b> and the
        community for the energy they sparked. It was the first time I felt truly
        excited about building something over the summer.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        Then on August 23rd, 2024, <a
          href="https://buildspace.so/letter"
          class="text-link">Buildspace closed for good</a
        >. It hit hard — really hard. It left a void ... but also a burning
        idea. This spark only existed because of Buildspace. I still listen to
        "All the Way" by Buildspace — it's one of my favorite songs. That energy
        never left.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
        After Buildspace ended, I didn't work much. I took a break. Then on <b
          >October 8th, 2024</b
        >, I started building a new website. It was the first version of Savant.
        I worked on components, interfaces and features for over a month. On <b
          >November 4th, 2024</b
        >, all the key pieces were in place and the MVP was ready. That's when
        the idea truly began to take shape. That was the true beginning.
