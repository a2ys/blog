      Savant is a community blog, where everyone has a chance to share their

    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg mt-4">
      Savant started in early November of 2024 as a successor to my old <a
        href="https://legacy.blog.a2ys.dev"
        class="text-link">blog</a
      >. Compared to the previous blog, this blog has a new and required feature
      which is collaboration with other authors.
    </p><p class="text-lg mt-4">
      Savant allows anyone to share their knowledge to the world if they want.
      All the articles in the Savant blog will be available on GitHub <a
        href="https://github.com/a2ys/blog"
        class="text-link">here</a
      >, and will accept any changes if required. You can contribute to any
      article you want, or write a completely new article for the blog.
    </p><p class="text-lg mt-4">More features will be added to the blog!</p>
