## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that allows you to build APIs quickly and efficiently. With its intuitive design and automatic documentation generation, it’s an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned developers.

This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple RESTful API with FastAPI, covering everything from setup to handling requests.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is known for its speed and ease of use. Its main benefits include:

- **Automatic OpenAPI docs**: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically.
- **Async Support**: FastAPI is built on ASGI, providing full support for asynchronous code.
- **Type Hints**: It uses Python's type hints to simplify data validation and error handling.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.
2. Basic knowledge of Python and RESTful APIs.

## Installation

To install FastAPI, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

Uvicorn is an ASGI server used to run FastAPI applications.

## Creating Your First Endpoint

Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” API endpoint using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

To run this API:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the JSON response.

## Handling Data with POST Requests

Now, let’s add a POST request to handle user input:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_description": item.description}
```

You can test this endpoint with JSON data using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Conclusion

This guide introduced you to the basics of building a RESTful API using FastAPI. With just a few lines of code, you can create scalable, efficient APIs. Dive deeper by exploring FastAPI’s documentation, and start building powerful backend services.
