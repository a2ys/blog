## Contributing to Savant

To contribute to Savant, follow these steps:

- Fork the Savant repository on GitHub.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- Install the project dependencies using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Make your changes as mentioned below.

  - Add a new blog post to the `src/content/blog` directory. You can use an existing post as a template. You can learn markdown syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
  - Then add your information with the file name the same as your `author` property set in the blog post in the `src/content/author` directory. You can take help from the existing files.
  - Also, don't forget to add your avatar image in the `public/` directory. You can use the existing images as a reference. You can add any image as your avatar, but make sure it's square and not too large.
  - If you want to add a thumbnail image for your blog post, add it to the `public/` directory and use the file name in the `thumbnail` property of your blog post. It is optional but recommended.

  For example, if your author property is `aayush-shukla`, then create a file named `aayush-shukla.md` in the `src/content/author` directory.

  Here, see this:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Some title
    tags: ["Your", "Tags"]
    date: 2024-11-03
    description: Your post description
    thumbnail: /{your-thumbnail-image-name} (optional)
    author: your-name
    ---

    Your post content goes here.
    ```

    Then in the `src/content/author` directory, create a file named `your-name.md` and add your information like this:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: Your Name
    bio: Your bio
    avatar: /{your-image-name}
    email: your-email (optional)

    twitter: your-twitter (optional)
    linkedin: your-linkedin (optional)
    website: your-website (optional)
    ---
    ```
