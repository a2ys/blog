Savant <i class="text-slate-600 text-xl">/'savnt/</i> </h2> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8"> <b>(noun)</b> A person who has an exceptional aptitude in one particular
        field, such as music or mathematics, despite having significant impairment
        in other areas of intellectual or social functioning.
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Why Savant?</h3> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
Savant is a community blog, where everyone has a chance to share their
        knowledge. It was born in early November 2024 as a modern successor to
        my old
<a href="https://legacy.blog.a2ys.dev" class="text-link">blog</a>.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
Unlike before, Savant focuses on collaboration. Anyone can contribute
        articles, suggest edits, or submit entirely new ideas. Every piece of
        content is hosted publicly on
<a href="https://github.com/a2ys/blog" class="text-link">GitHub</a> so it's
        transparent, editable, and open-source.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
Whether you're a student, developer, or hobbyist â€” if you've got
        something worth sharing, Savant gives you a stage.
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">The Backstory</h3> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
It all started with <b>Buildspace</b> on July 6th, 2024 â€” with the 5th season
        of their
<a href="https://x.com/unreal_sapien/status/1809572446896550320" class="text-link">Nights & Weekends</a> program. That's where the idea for Savant first took shape. The journey
        was genuinely inspiring, and I'm deeply grateful to <b>Farza</b> and the
        community for the energy they sparked. It was the first time I felt truly
        excited about building something over the summer.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
Then on August 23rd, 2024, <a href="https://buildspace.so/letter" class="text-link">Buildspace closed for good</a>. It hit hard â€” really hard. It left a void ... but also a burning
        idea. This spark only existed because of Buildspace. I still listen to
        "All the Way" by Buildspace â€” it's one of my favorite songs. That energy
        never left.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
After Buildspace ended, I didn't work much. I took a break. Then on <b>October 8th, 2024</b>, I started building a new website. It was the first version of Savant.
        I worked on components, interfaces and features for over a month. On <b>November 4th, 2024</b>, all the key pieces were in place and the MVP was ready. That's when
        the idea truly began to take shape. That was the true beginning.

The Journey So Far
</div> <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 text-lg mb-12"> <li><b>Nov 4, 2024</b> â€” MVP of Savant was ready ðŸš€</li> <li> <b>Dec 6, 2024</b> â€” Tweaked fonts, added math support, post sorting by
          date, revamped code color scheme, added tag components, and reorganized
          all paths
</li> <li> <b>Dec 8, 2024</b> â€” Integrated PostHog for analytics and created the Author
          component
</li> <li> <b>Feb 26, 2025</b> â€” Added draft post support and kicked off multi-author
          infrastructure
</li> <li> <b>May 22-25, 2025</b> â€” Introduced series support with custom ordering,
          removed tags, completely revamped the UI with new schema, colors, subtle

</li> <li> <b>Coming Soon</b> â€” Full multi-author publishing, more helpful blogs,
          new voices (ðŸ‘€), and a bunch of cool stuff I probably haven't even thought
